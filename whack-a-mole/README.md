# Whack-a-Mole
Borrowed from / inspired by [Wes Bos 30-Day JS Challenge](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30/tree/master/30%20-%20Whack%20A%20Mole)

# To Dos
Before you start open up index.html in the browser and play around with adding the `up` class to a `hole` element (i.e. the element with the `hole` class). The goal of this project is to add / remove the up class on an interval, capture the click of the mole and increment the score if the mole is "whacked". Add code to moles.js to make that happen.
